# Getting familiar

This simple project was created with the purpose getting familiar with React.
I didn't use any management libraries in this project. All state is stored in the component App.js

## Used libraries

React, React-router-dom v6, react-transition-group, axios

## Available routing

"/", "/about", "/posts", "/posts:id"
